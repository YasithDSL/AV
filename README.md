# Algorithm Visualiser

This is a visualiser project, which enables users to view the performance and method used by algorithms to complete a task. There are 3 main sections, the pathfinding visualisation, array sorting visualisation and a detection tool (which is more of a bonus). 

## Pathfinding Visualisation

The pathfinding section provides a grid based cell user interface.

## Array Sorting

The array sorting section provides a bar-chart like interface where each bar represents one integer in an aray, which the algorithms will run on.

## Detection Tool

The detection tool is based on Google's Teachable Machine (MobileNet) Image based classification model. The model outputs currently probabilities for each array sorting algorithms suitability but will be expanded upon for greater accuracy and for pathfinding.
